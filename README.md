### GROUP CULTURE
- we don't pull all nighters
- we are strategic with bdd, and design process. things change, but we talk about it.
- we time box spiking sessions. when in doubt, the group decides whether a spike is worth the time
- group decision making about workflow, and merging. Everyone is accountable for everyone else's understanding of the code base
- mix and match pairs through the process
